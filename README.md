# What Platform?

## Introduction

Getting a commuter train out of central London at rush hour inevitably involves a mass rush to the platform once your platform number is announced on the departure boards — and a lottery on whether you will get a seat. I recently discovered that departure platforms are known far in advance and that this data is publicly available[^1]. The interface for browsing this data is lacking, so I wanted to build an intuitive service for finding this information as quickly and easily as possible.
